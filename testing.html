  <p>ဒီသင်တန်းမှာဆိုရင်တော့ AIနဲ့ပတ်သတ်တဲ့အခြေခံတွေကို လေ့လာရမှာဖြစ်ပြီး  AI ရဲ့ အခွဲတွေဖြစ်တဲ့ မသိမဖြစ် Machine Learning, ခေတ်စားလာတယ့် Deep Learning နဲ့ စာတွေ အသံတွေကို စက်နားလည်လာအောင် သင်ပေးနိုင့်မယ့် Natural Language Processing (Burmese Language) အကြောင်းတွေကိုပါ လေ့လာရမှာဖြစ်ပါတယ်။ Python Programming Language ကိုအသုံးပြုပြီး မိမိကိုယ်တိုင် AI နဲ့ ပတ်သတ်တဲ့ Project တွေကို လုပ်ဆောင်နိုင်မှာဖြစ်ပါတယ်။

  <p>Artificial Intelligence becomes a part of our daily lives starting from personal assistants to advanced technology. Recently, AI solved the problem of protein folding which was unsolvable for many decades. AI becomes a hope for the people who are not able to see and hear. It is incredible. It is a double sword technology. One thing to notice is that it is just a tool and the results obtained would be different based on who uses it.
  That is why everyone should access the education of AI. But the curriculum must consider different aspects.
  Let's learn AI and use it to make our world a better place.
